          Learning Philosophy

        <p style="line-height: 1.8">
          As a self-taught developer with formal education, I believe in
          continuous learning and hands-on experience. Each project is an
          opportunity to master new technologies and solve real-world problems.
          Currently building my certification portfolio while focusing on
          practical, real-world development skills.
